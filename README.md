## How to Play:
Maze Chase is a 3d Maze game with a number of paths and checkpoints diplayed on the map as circular platforms(mostly red except the start and finish points). The Goal of the player is to search for the RIGHT path from the start to the end that will lead the player to Victory. On reaching the finish line the game will terminate automatically and after quitting, you will find a flag.txt file in the launch folder.
On choosing the wrong path in the game the flag.txt file will display "Not the Right way!!!" but if you choose the destined path you will achieve your flag for the challenge in the flag.txt file.
To know the solution check the Solution.md file in the Solution folder.
